React Drag-n-Drop notes:

•	Draggable component (card), must accept “id” and “text” props. Draggable component must have a ref={drag}. Where “drag” is destructured from useDrag() hook; “drag” allows us to track which component that is being dragged.
const [ {isDragging }, drag ] = useDrag( () => {
type: “card”,
item: {id: id, text: text},
collect: () => {}
})
•	Droppable component (list), must use useDrop() hook: 
const [ {isOver}, drop ] = useDrop({
 accept: “type string”,    // what kind of element types does this component accept?
 drop: (card) => addCardToBoard(card.id) // function that runs whenever we drop something into this component
})
