   - TO DO:

   1. Create createAsyncThunk's for moveCard, addcard, addBoard, addList. (check)

   2. create extrareducers for:
    - addCardThunk (check)
    - moveCardThunk (check)
    - addListThunk (check)
    - addBoardThunk (check)
    
   3. create action creators and reducers for addBoard and addList
   4. add moveCardThunk to List.js (check)
   5. add addCardThunk to AddItem.js (check)
   6. Commit and create a PR
   7. Troubleshoot full stack version of the app
   8. Work on AddItem.js component
   9. Create a component/action that hydrates state from DB on app load
   10. Deploy app

user addCard adds card with ReduxId and Name: 

dispatch(addCard({ boardId, listId, _id, inputValue }))

inside the same click handler a thunk action is dispatched: 

dispatch(addCardThunk({ listId, inputValue }))

when card comes back from API, card object with the REAL id will be processed inside extraReducers. Here in order to find the card whose temporart ID  must be updated, we'll either need to parse the entire redux store tree to find the card by its name (consuming more resources), or backend can respond witht the board._id and temporary._id value, so that the card in need of id update can be easiy found without having to parse the entire redux state.
