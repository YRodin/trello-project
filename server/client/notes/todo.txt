Redux Toolkit:
Create following slices and action creators:
dragAndDrop slice: startDrag/stopDrag action creators:  use to change UI elements
moveCard: change state boards' composition depending on user dragging cards from list to list; 


Data Flow: 

REdux State gets hydrated from backend api; (for now hardcoded);

(Boards and Cards get their props from Redux State: const boards = useSelecotor(state => state.boards);)

DRAG PORTION OF moveCard action: Movig a card from one board to another means filtering Source Board array for Cards whos ids are not equal to source card;

DROP PORTION of moveCard action: means adding a source card to the Target Boad array.

Props needed to obtain during drag and drop:
- DRAG SOURCE BOARD ID
- DROP SOUCE BOARD ID
- CARD ID


Component hierarchy and prop management:
HomeScreen renders Board and Board renders Cards
